Project Details :  I developed a fully functional E-Learning Platform using only frontend technologies. The idea behind this project was to simulate a simplified online classroom experience that includes video-based lessons, interactive quizzes, and progress tracking—without requiring a backend server. The goal was to make learning accessible, intuitive, and engaging, all while strengthening my frontend development skills.

The platform was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The structure of the site is clean and organized, with clearly defined sections such as a course overview, a video lesson module, a quiz section, and a progress tracker. I wanted to ensure that even users with minimal technical knowledge could easily navigate and interact with the platform. Every part of the interface was designed to be user-friendly and responsive, so it works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

To implement video lessons, I used the HTML5 <video> tag, embedding course content directly into the page. I added a "Mark as Watched" button under each video. When a user clicks it, their progress is stored in the browser using LocalStorage, so they don’t lose their learning status even if they close or refresh the tab. This lightweight method ensures users have a continuous learning experience without requiring user accounts or databases.

In addition to video content, I built a small quiz section where users can test their understanding. For this, I used JavaScript to check the user’s answer and display instant feedback. It’s a basic setup, but enough to demonstrate interactivity and enhance the learning process. The quiz for this version focuses on HTML fundamentals, which ties directly to the video lesson topic.

All coding was done using Visual Studio Code, with Git for version control. I uploaded the project to GitHub for easy sharing and future updates. Though simple in its current state, the platform is designed to be scalable. More lessons, questions, or even user authentication features can be added later.

Tools & Technologies Used:
HTML5 for content structure

CSS3 for layout and responsive design

JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity

LocalStorage for saving progress data

Visual Studio Code as the development environment

Git & GitHub for version control and hosting

Real-World Use Cases:
This platform could be useful for educators sharing pre-recorded lessons, students creating their own learning modules, or freelancers building tutorial-based websites. It can serve as a foundation for more complex e-learning solutions, like adding user login, backend databases, and certification modules.

What I Learned:
Through this project, I learned how to build structured learning pages, implement browser-based data storage, and create interactive learning components with JavaScript. It taught me how to think like a user and create a functional learning flow from start to finish. More importantly, it gave me confidence in building real-world frontend applications that serve a clear purpose.
